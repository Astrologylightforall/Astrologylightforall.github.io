                            <p>Love is not just about emotions—it's about energy, timing, and connection.</p>
                            <p>Ever wondered why some relationships feel effortless and some constantly feel like a struggle?</p>
                            <p>Astrology can show us whether two people's energies naturally flow together or if they're clashing silently.</p>
                            <p>We look at your charts together—like checking the wiring behind two devices. Will they run smoothly? Or will sparks fly in the wrong way?</p>
                            <p><strong>We've helped people:</strong></p>
                            <p>• Decide when to propose or marry for the best chances of harmony.</p>
                            <p>• Understand why arguments happen again and again.</p>
                            <p>• See whether it's real love or a passing phase.</p>
                            <p>This isn't about forcing relationships—it's about clarity, respect, and long-term peace.</p>
                            <p>Because true love grows best when it's understood, not just felt.</p>

                            <h3>KUNDALI ANALYSIS</h3>
                            <p>Think of your <strong>Kundali</strong> like your life's <strong>X-ray or blood report</strong>.</p>
                            <p>When you're feeling unwell, the doctor runs tests to find the exact issue before giving any medicine, right?</p>
                            <p>Your birth chart works the same way. It holds every detail about your <strong>mind, emotions, career, relationships, health, strengths, and hidden challenges</strong>.</p>
                            <p><strong>Sometimes people come to us saying:</strong></p>
                            <p>• "I keep changing jobs, but nothing feels right."</p>
                            <p>• "I love someone, but there's always a delay in marriage."</p>
                            <p>• "Business was going well, but suddenly everything slowed down."</p>
                            <p>• "I'm earning well, but there's no peace at home."</p>
                            <p>In such cases, we don't give random advice.</p>
                            <p>We <strong>read your Kundali just like a report</strong>, and often, the answers are right there—maybe a weak planet, a delayed timing, or a pattern you don't notice.</p>
                            <p>The beauty of astrology is not in fear, but in <strong>awareness and timing</strong>. Once we know <strong>what</strong> and <strong>why</strong>, we can suggest <strong>when</strong> and <strong>how to fix it</strong>—whether it's a remedy, a change in approach, or just waiting for the right time.</p>
                            <p>And just like in medical reports, early awareness means faster healing.</p>
                            <p>Let us help you see the full picture of your life.</p>
                            <p>Because sometimes, all it takes is one small shift in understanding to change everything.</p>

                            <h3>GEMSTONE RECOMMENDATION</h3>
                            <p>Think of a <strong>gemstone</strong> like a small power bank you carry for your inner energy.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes in life, we feel low, stuck, or confused—not because we're weak, but because one part of our astrological chart is not getting the right support.</p>
                            <p>Just like when our body is low on vitamins and we take supplements, similarly, a well-matched gemstone gives strength to the weak planet in your chart.</p>
                            <p>But here's the truth—wearing the wrong stone is like taking the wrong medicine. That's why we <strong>never recommend a gem without reading your chart carefully</strong>.</p>
                            <p><strong>Example?</strong></p>
                            <p>Someone wearing a Blue Sapphire without needing it might face unnecessary anxiety or obstacles. But for the right person, it can bring immense clarity and financial growth.</p>
                            <p>We guide you to the <strong>right stone</strong>, the <strong>right finger</strong>, and even the <strong>right day and time to wear it</strong>—because it's not about trends; it's about transformation.</p>

                            <p>Your home is your <strong>silent partner</strong> in life's journey.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes, things feel off for no visible reason—money gets stuck, relationships feel tense, or health issues repeat. In such times, it's worth checking the <strong>energy map of your space</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Vastu is not about breaking walls. It's about small changes that bring big shifts.</p>
                            <p><strong>Simple things like:</strong></p>
                            <p>• Shifting your bed's direction</p>
                            <p>• Placing a mirror correctly</p>
                            <p>• Or avoiding clutter in key corners</p>
                            <p>can open the door to peace and prosperity.</p>
                            <p>We treat every home like a living being. Just like your body needs balance, so does your space.</p>

                            <p>The right mantra brings peace, power, and success. But the wrong one? It can create invisible blocks in your path—even if you're working hard.</p>
                            <p>Numerology studies the <strong>vibrations of numbers and letters</strong>. Your date of birth, your name, and even your business name carry energy. When these align, things begin to flow more naturally.</p>
                            <p><strong>We've seen it many times:</strong></p>
                            <p>• People who changed a single letter in their name and found new success.</p>
                            <p>• Kids who started performing better after a name correction.</p>
                            <p>• Business owners who turned things around just by adjusting their brand name with numerology.</p>
                            <p>It's not superstition. It's <strong>energy alignment</strong>.</p>
                            <p>Let's find the name that truly speaks your destiny.</p>

            <div class="about-content">
                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>I come from a family where tradition, trust, and helping others has always been a way of life. While our family has been in the jewellery business for many years, our true connection has always been with astrology. My father has been a full-time astrologer for over 30 years, and I've seen him guide people with care, honesty, and deep knowledge.</p>
                <p>My journey into astrology began when I was just 13. I would sit beside my father as he read Kundali and shared insights with people. I didn't fully understand everything back then, but I was drawn to it. Slowly, I started learning more about Kundali analysis and numerology—and before I knew it, it became a part of who I am.</p>
                <p>My elder brother, who is 16, is also learning this ancient science alongside me. Together, we are building our knowledge and carrying forward our family's tradition of guidance and care.</p>
                <p>Now, with over 17 years of experience, I work alongside my father, and together we help people find clarity in different areas of life—whether it's career, love, marriage, business, money matters, or property issues.</p>
                <p>At Astrology Light For All, we don't just read charts—we listen, we guide, and we care. Every person we meet has a unique story, and we feel blessed to be able to help them find light and direction on their journey.</p>
